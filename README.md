# Tekken Moves
This is a very simple frontend-only project I did with Svelte.

It requires a large JSON file to feed it Tekken 7 moves (`/src/assets/moves.json`) and it spits out clickable Svelte components containing information about the move.

This was my introduction to Svelte, and even though the app *(somewhat)* works, I still have heaps to learn about it, and in the future SvelteKit.

An online version is available at [arijanj.github.io/tekken](https://arijanj.github.io/tekken/).
